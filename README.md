# BridgerBowlWetland
This GitHub contains information about the waste water treatment facility at Bridger Bowl in Bozeman, MT.
# Purpose
A pilot-scale two-stage vertical flow treatment wetland (VFTW) at the Bridger Bowl Ski Area was used to evaluate the influence of hydraulic loading rate on COD removal, nitrification, and denitrification in the system.
The goal of the VTFW is to treet pre-settled wastewater to meet DEQ requirements.
# Site Background
The Bridger Bowl Ski Area, which hosts the experimental treatment wetland of study, is situated northeast of Bozeman, Montana, on the east slope of the Bridger Mountain Range. A popular destination just 30 km from the Montana State University campus, Bridger Bowl has reliable wastewater flows and the location allows for convenient maintenance and sampling. The treatment wetland is located under the Virginia City lift, on the border of the Coyote Flats ski run between the main lower lodges and the Deer Park Chalet. As of Summer 2018, it shares this space with the fullscale treatment wetland that was designed, in part, by utilizing data collected previously from the experimental VFTW system. The treatment wetland processes waste from the lower lodges of the ski area, and as such is operated primarily during the ski season, typically from mid-December to early April. Bridger Bowl receives approximately 9 m of snow annually, and during theoperating season air temperatures can drop as low as -17°C, as measured at the Alpine Lodge during the 2018 – 2019 ski season. These extreme weather conditions, when considered alongside the high-strength wastewater, allow for this system to be a study of the efficacy of wastewater treatment wetlands in a high stress environment.
# General Process of System Design
The pilot-scale experimental system is a two-stage vertical flow treatment wetland. Treatment begins within two A cells (A1 and A2) and progresses to two B cells (B1 and B2). The two cells of each stage are identical and operated in parallel with mixing of individual cell effluent between stages. All cells have square surface areas of 23.8 m2, with a depth of approximately 1.2 m and 26 cm freeboard. The cells have layered media, beginning with a bottom drainage layer, followed by transition, treatment, and protective layers. Each cell is lined with a geotextile fabric to create a watertight environment and sits on a 5 cm sand layer for support. Distribution and collection pipes are located immediately below the protective layer and within the drainage layer, respectively.

# Lab Methods
All water quality testing was conducted at the Environmental Engineering Lab at Montana State University. All samples were tested for nitrate, ammonium, and chemical oxygen demand (COD). Results for total nitrogen (TN) are the sum of nitrate and ammonium measurements. Periodically, selected samples were also tested for total Kjeldhal nitrogen (TKN).
# Lab Results
Results are highly dependant on the year, flow rate, pump schedule, and other environmental factors. Please explore the GitHub in order to access different results and sisscussions from previous years/students.
