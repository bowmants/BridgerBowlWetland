# BridgerBowlWetland
This GitHub contains information about the waste water treatment facility at Bridger Bowl in Bozeman, MT.
# Purpose
A pilot-scale two-stage vertical flow treatment wetland (VFTW) at the Bridger Bowl Ski Area was used to evaluate the influence of hydraulic loading rate on COD removal, nitrification, and denitrification in the system.
The goal of the VTFW is to treet pre-settled wastewater to meet DEQ requirements.
