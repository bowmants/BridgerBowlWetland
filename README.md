# BridgerBowlWetland
This GitHub contains information about the waste water treatment facility at Bridger Bowl in Bozeman, MT.
# Purpose
A pilot-scale two-stage vertical flow treatment wetland (VFTW) at the Bridger Bowl Ski Area was used to evaluate the influence of hydraulic loading rate on COD removal, nitrification, and denitrification in the system.
The goal of the VTFW is to treet pre-settled wastewater to meet DEQ requirements.
# Site Background
The Bridger Bowl Ski Area, which hosts the experimental treatment wetland of study, is situated northeast of Bozeman, Montana, on the east slope of the Bridger Mountain Range. A popular destination just 30 km from the Montana State University campus, Bridger Bowl has reliable wastewater flows and the location allows for convenient maintenance and sampling. The treatment wetland is located under the Virginia City lift, on the border of the Coyote Flats ski run between the main lower lodges and the Deer Park Chalet. As of Summer 2018, it shares this space with the fullscale treatment wetland that was designed, in part, by utilizing data collected previously from the experimental VFTW system. The treatment wetland processes waste from the lower lodges of the ski area, and as such is operated primarily during the ski season, typically from mid-December to early April. Bridger Bowl receives approximately 9 m of snow annually, and during theoperating season air temperatures can drop as low as -17°C, as measured at the Alpine Lodge during the 2018 – 2019 ski season. These extreme weather conditions, when considered alongside the high-strength wastewater, allow for this system to be a study of the efficacy of wastewater treatment wetlands in a high stress environment.
